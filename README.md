## Description

Rythymania is a rhythm game inspired by Dance Dance Revolution. Try to hit the notes as they scroll up the screen to the tune of five different songs.

Rythymania is made using javascript, mainly the javascript canvas in order to properly draw the background video as well as scroll the notes up the screen with correct timing.
